# rfcs
RFCs for changes to OBS Studio (and supporting toolset)


Basic RFC process:
- Fork the repo
- Copy `0000-template.md` to `accepted/XXXX-my-rfc-title.md`. Make sure
  the title is descriptive. RFC number should match the next PR number.
- Fill out the RFC template. Our template is a bit basic right now, so
  I recommend looking at the other submitted RFCs for guidance.
- Submit the RFC as a pull request.


Things to keep in mind:
- An RFC is designed to be an open discussion. Please be accepting to
  and reponsive to any feedback, even if you do not agree.
- Not all RFCs will be accepted. Some may require extensive work or
  deviation from their original submissions.
- As always, be kind and respectul with your discussions.
